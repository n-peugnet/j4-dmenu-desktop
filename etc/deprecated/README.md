Deprecated shell completions.

Do not use these! If you want completions, [look in the parent directory](../).

These completions are handwritten. They will likely not be up-to-date with
current j4-dmenu-desktop.

It shouldn't be that hard to update them. If crazy-complete stops being
reliable, j4-dmenu-desktop can switch back to these handwritten completion
scripts.

The `complgen` file is the remains of j4-dmenu-desktop's
[complgen](https://github.com/adaszko/complgen) integration.
